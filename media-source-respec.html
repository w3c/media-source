    <section id="abstract">
      This specification extends {{HTMLMediaElement}} [[HTML]] to allow
      JavaScript to generate media streams for playback.
      Allowing JavaScript to generate streams facilitates a variety of use
      cases like adaptive streaming and time shifting live streams.
    </section>

    <section id="introduction" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This specification allows JavaScript to dynamically construct media streams for &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;. It defines a MediaSource object that can serve as a source of media data for an HTMLMediaElement. MediaSource objects have one or more <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects.  Applications append data segments to the <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects, and can adapt the quality of appended data based on system performance and other factors. Data from the <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects is managed as track buffers for audio, video and text data that is decoded and played. Byte stream specifications used with these extensions are available in the byte stream format registry [[MSE-REGISTRY]].</p>

      <section id="goals">
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>This specification was designed with the following goals in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow JavaScript to construct media streams independent of how the media is fetched.</li>
          <li>Define a splicing and buffering model that facilitates use cases like adaptive streaming, ad-insertion, time-shifting, and video editing.</li>
          <li>Minimize the need for media parsing in JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Leverage the browser cache as much as possible.</li>
          <li>Provide requirements for byte stream format specifications.</li>
          <li>Not require support for any particular media format or codec.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This specification defines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Normative behavior for user agents to enable interoperability between user agents and web applications when processing media data.</li>
          <li>Normative requirements to enable other specifications to define media formats to be used within this specification.</li>
        </ul>

          <dt><dfn id="append-window">Append Window</dfn></dt>
          <dd><p>A [=presentation timestamp=] range used to filter out [=coded frames=] while appending. The append window represents a single
            continuous time range with a single start time and end time. Coded frames with [=presentation timestamp=] within this range are allowed to be appended
            to the <a>SourceBuffer</a> while coded frames outside this range are filtered out. The append window start and end times are controlled by
            the {{SourceBuffer/appendWindowStart}} and {{SourceBuffer/appendWindowEnd}} attributes respectively.</p></dd>

          <dt><dfn id="coded-frame" data-export="">Coded Frame</dfn></dt>

            <p>The duration of a [=coded frame=]. For video and text, the duration indicates how long the video frame or text SHOULD be displayed. For audio, the duration represents the sum of all the samples contained within the coded frame. For example, if an audio frame contained 441 samples @44100Hz the frame duration would be 10 milliseconds.</p>

If frames can be decoded out of [=presentation order=], then the decode timestamp MUST be present in or derivable from the byte stream. The user agent MUST run the [=append error=] algorithm if this is not the case. If frames cannot be decoded out of  [=presentation order=] and a decode timestamp is not present in the byte stream, then the decode timestamp is equal to the [=presentation timestamp=].</p>

          <dd>
            <p>A sequence of bytes that contain all of the initialization information required to decode a sequence of [=media segments=]. This includes codec initialization data, [=Track ID=] mappings for multiplexed segments, and timestamp offsets (e.g., edit lists).</p>

          <dd>
            <p>A MediaSource object URL is a unique <a def-id="blob-uri"></a> [[FILE-API]] created by {{URL/createObjectURL()}}. It is used to attach a <a>MediaSource</a> object to an HTMLMediaElement.</p>

            <p>The [=origin=] of the MediaSource object URL is the [=relevant settings object=] of <code>this</code> during the call to {{URL/createObjectURL()}}.</p>
            <p class="note">For example, the [=origin=] of the MediaSource object URL affects the way that the media element is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#security-with-canvas-elements">consumed by canvas</a>.</p>

All presentations created using this specification have a presentation start time of 0.</p>

          <p class="note">For the purposes of determining if {{HTMLMediaElement}}.{{HTMLMediaElement/buffered}} contains a {{TimeRanges}} that includes the current playback position, implementations MAY choose to allow a current playback position at or after [=presentation start time=] and before the first {{TimeRanges}} to play the first {{TimeRanges}} if that {{TimeRanges}} starts within a reasonably short time, like 1 second, after [=presentation start time=]. This allowance accommodates the reality that muxed streams commonly do not begin all tracks precisely at [=presentation start time=]. Implementations MUST report the actual buffered range, regardless of this allowance.</p>

          <dt><dfn id="presentation-interval">Presentation Interval</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The presentation interval of a [=coded frame=] is the time interval from its [=presentation timestamp=] to the [=presentation timestamp=] plus the [=coded frame duration|coded frame's duration=]. For example, if a coded frame has a presentation timestamp of 10 seconds and a [=coded frame duration=] of 100 milliseconds, then the presentation interval would be [10-10.1). Note that the start of the range is inclusive, but the end of the range is exclusive.</p>

      <h2><dfn>MediaSource</dfn> Object</h2>
      <p>The MediaSource object represents a source of media data for an HTMLMediaElement. It keeps track of the {{MediaSource/readyState}} for this source as well as a list of <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects that can be used to add media data to the presentation. MediaSource objects are created by the web application and then attached to an HTMLMediaElement. The application uses the <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects in {{MediaSource/sourceBuffers}} to add media data to this source. The HTMLMediaElement fetches this media data from the <a>MediaSource</a> object when it is needed during playback.</p>

      <p>Each <a>MediaSource</a> object has a <dfn id="live-seekable-range">live seekable range</dfn> variable that stores a <a def-id="normalized-timeranges-object"></a>.  This variable is initialized to an empty {{TimeRanges}} object when the <a>MediaSource</a> object is created, is maintained by {{MediaSource/setLiveSeekableRange()}} and {{MediaSource/clearLiveSeekableRange()}}, and is used in <a href="#htmlmediaelement-extensions">HTMLMediaElement Extensions</a> to modify {{HTMLMediaElement}}.{{HTMLMediaElement/seekable}} behavior.</p>

          <h4><dfn>Attaching to a media element</dfn></h4>
          <p> A <a>MediaSource</a> object can be attached to a media element by assigning a [=MediaSource object URL=] to the media element {{HTMLMediaElement/src}} attribute or the src attribute of a &lt;source&gt; inside a media element. A [=MediaSource object URL=] is created by passing a MediaSource object to {{URL/createObjectURL()}}.</p>

          <p>If the <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a> was invoked with
          a media provider object that is a MediaSource object or a URL record whose object is a MediaSource object,
          then let mode be local, skip the first step in the <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a>
          (which may otherwise set mode to remote) and add the steps and clarifications below to the <a def-id="Otherwise-mode-is-local"></a> section of the <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a>.
          <p class="note">The <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a>'s first step is expected to eventually align with selecting local mode for URL records whose objects are media provider objects. The intent is that if the HTMLMediaElement's <code>src</code> attribute or selected child <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>'s <code>src</code> attribute is a <code>blob:</code> URL matching a [=MediaSource object URL=] when the respective <code>src</code> attribute was last changed, then that MediaSource object is used as the media provider object and current media resource in the local mode logic in the <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a>. This also means that the remote mode logic that includes observance of any preload attribute is skipped when a MediaSource object is attached. Even with that eventual change to [[HTML]], the execution of the following steps at the beginning of the local mode logic is still required when the current media resource is a MediaSource object.</p>
          <p class="note">Relative to the action which triggered the media element's resource selection algorithm, these steps are asynchronous. The resource fetch algorithm is run after the task that invoked the resource selection algorithm is allowed to continue and a stable state is reached. Implementations may delay the steps in the "<i>Otherwise</i>" clause, below, until the MediaSource object is ready for use.</p>

          </dl>
          <p class="note">An attached MediaSource does not use the remote mode steps in the <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a>, so the media element will not fire "suspend" events. Though future versions of this specification will likely remove "progress" and "stalled" events from a media element with an attached MediaSource, user agents conforming to this version of the specification may still fire these two events as these [[HTML]] references changed after implementations of this specification stabilized.</p>

        <section id="buffer-monitoring">
          <h4><dfn>SourceBuffer Monitoring</dfn></h4>
          <p>The following steps are periodically run during playback to make sure that all of the <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects in {{MediaSource/activeSourceBuffers}} have [=enough data to ensure uninterrupted playback=]. Changes to {{MediaSource/activeSourceBuffers}} also cause these steps to run because they affect the conditions that trigger state transitions.</p>

          <p>Having <dfn id="enough-data">enough data to ensure uninterrupted playback</dfn> is an implementation specific condition where the user agent
          determines that it currently has enough data to play the presentation without stalling for a meaningful period of time. This condition is
          constantly evaluated to determine when to transition the media element into and out of the <a def-id="have-enough-data"></a> ready state.
          These transitions indicate when the user agent believes it has enough data buffered or it needs more data respectively.</p>

          <p class="note">An implementation MAY choose to use bytes buffered, time buffered, the append rate, or any other metric it sees fit to
            determine when it has enough data. The metrics used MAY change during playback so web applications SHOULD only rely on the value of
            {{HTMLMediaElement}}.{{HTMLMediaElement/readyState}} to determine whether more data is needed or not.</p>

          <p class="note">When the media element needs more data, the user agent SHOULD transition it from <a def-id="have-enough-data"></a> to
            <a def-id="have-future-data"></a> early enough for a web application to be able to respond without causing an interruption in playback.
            For example, transitioning when the current playback position is 500ms before the end of the buffered data gives the application roughly
            500ms to append more data before playback stalls.</p>

        <h3>Track Buffers</h3>
        <p>A <dfn id="track-buffer">track buffer</dfn> stores the [=track descriptions=] and [=coded frames=] for an individual
          track. The track buffer is updated as [=initialization segments=] and [=media segments=] are appended to the
          <a>SourceBuffer</a>.</p>

        <p>Each [=track buffer=] has a <dfn id="last-decode-timestamp">last decode timestamp</dfn> variable that stores
          the decode timestamp of the last [=coded frame=] appended in the current [=coded frame group=]. The variable is initially
          unset to indicate that no [=coded frames=] have been appended yet.</p>

        <p>Each [=track buffer=] has a <dfn id="last-frame-duration">last frame duration</dfn> variable that stores
          the [=coded frame duration=] of the last [=coded frame=] appended in the current [=coded frame group=]. The variable is initially
          unset to indicate that no [=coded frames=] have been appended yet.</p>

        <p>Each [=track buffer=] has a <dfn id="highest-end-timestamp">highest end timestamp</dfn> variable that stores
            the highest [=coded frame end timestamp=] across all [=coded frames=] in
            the current [=coded frame group=] that were appended to this track buffer.
            The variable is initially unset to indicate that no [=coded frames=] have been appended yet.</p>

        <p>Each [=track buffer=] has a <dfn id="need-RAP-flag">need random access point flag</dfn> variable that keeps track of whether
          the track buffer is waiting for a [=random access point=] [=coded frame=]. The variable is initially set to true to
          indicate that [=random access point=] [=coded frame=] is needed before anything can be added to the
          [=track buffer=].</p>

        <p>Each [=track buffer=] has a <dfn id="track-buffer-ranges">track buffer ranges</dfn> variable that represents the presentation time ranges occupied by the [=coded frames=] currently stored in the track buffer.</p>

          <p class="note">For track buffer ranges, these presentation time ranges are based on [=presentation timestamps=], frame durations, and potentially coded frame group start times for coded frame groups across track buffers in a muxed <a>SourceBuffer</a>.</p>

          <p>For specification purposes, this information is treated as if it were stored in a <a def-id="normalized-timeranges-object"></a>. Intersected [=track buffer ranges=] are used to report {{HTMLMediaElement}}.{{HTMLMediaElement/buffered}}, and MUST therefore support uninterrupted playback within each range of {{HTMLMediaElement}}.{{HTMLMediaElement/buffered}}.</p>

          <p class="note">These coded frame group start times differ slightly from those mentioned in the [=coded frame processing=] algorithm in that they are the earliest [=presentation timestamp=] across all track buffers following a discontinuity. Discontinuities can occur within the [=coded frame processing=] algorithm or result from the [=coded frame removal=] algorithm, regardless of {{SourceBuffer/mode}}.
          The threshold for determining disjointness of [=track buffer ranges=] is implementation-specific. For example, to reduce unexpected playback stalls, implementations MAY approximate the [=coded frame processing=] algorithm's discontinuity detection logic by coalescing adjacent ranges separated by a gap smaller than 2 times the maximum frame duration buffered so far in this [=track buffer=]. Implementations MAY also use coded frame group start times as range start times across [=track buffers=] in a muxed <a>SourceBuffer</a> to further reduce unexpected playback stalls.</p>

                          <p class="note">Special processing may be needed to determine the presentation and decode timestamps for timed text frames since this information may not be explicitly
                            present in the underlying format or may be dependent on the order of the frames. Some metadata text tracks, like MPEG2-TS PSI data, may only have implied timestamps.
                            Format specific rules for these situations SHOULD be in the [=byte stream format specifications=] or in separate extension specifications.</p>

                          <p class="note">Implementations don't have to internally store timestamps in a double precision floating point representation. This
                            representation is used here because it is the representation for timestamps in the HTML spec. The intention here is to make the
                            behavior clear without adding unnecessary complexity to the algorithm to deal with the fact that adding a timestampOffset may
                            cause a timestamp rollover in the underlying timestamp representation used by the byte stream format. Implementations can use any
                            internal timestamp representation they wish, but the addition of timestampOffset SHOULD behave in a similar manner to what would happen
                            if a double precision floating point representation was used.

    <section id="byte-stream-formats">
      <h2><dfn data-export="">Byte Stream Formats</dfn></h2>
      <p>The bytes provided through {{SourceBuffer/appendBuffer()}} for a <a>SourceBuffer</a> form a logical byte stream. The format and
        semantics of these byte streams are defined in <dfn id="byte-stream-format-specs">byte stream format specifications</dfn>.
        The byte stream format registry [[MSE-REGISTRY]] provides mappings between a MIME type that may be passed to {{MediaSource/addSourceBuffer()}} or
        {{MediaSource/isTypeSupported()}} and the byte stream format expected by a <a>SourceBuffer</a> created with that MIME type. Implementations are encouraged to register
        mappings for byte stream formats they support to facilitate interoperability. The byte stream format registry [[MSE-REGISTRY]] is the authoritative source for these
        mappings. If an implementation claims to support a MIME type listed in the registry, its <a>SourceBuffer</a> implementation MUST conform to the
        [=byte stream format specification=] listed in the registry entry.</p>
      <p class="note">The byte stream format specifications in the registry are not intended to define new storage formats. They simply outline the subset of
        existing storage format structures that implementations of this specification will accept.</p>
      <p class="note">Byte stream format parsing and validation is implemented in the [=segment parser loop=] algorithm.</p>

      <p>This section provides general requirements for all byte stream format specifications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A byte stream format specification MUST define [=initialization segments=] and [=media segments=].</li>
        <li>A byte stream format SHOULD provide references for sourcing {{AudioTrack}}, {{VideoTrack}}, and {{TextTrack}} attribute values
          from data in [=initialization segments=].
          <p class="note">If the byte stream format covers a format similar to one covered in the in-band tracks spec [[INBANDTRACKS]], then
            it SHOULD try to use the same attribute mappings so that Media Source Extensions playback and non-Media Source Extensions playback provide the
            same track information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>It MUST be possible to identify segment boundaries and segment type (initialization or media) by examining the byte stream alone.</li>
        <li>The user agent MUST run the [=append error=] algorithm when any of the following conditions are met:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The number and type of tracks are not consistent.</p>
              <p class="note">For example, if the first [=initialization segment=] has 2 audio tracks and 1 video track, then all [=initialization segments=] that follow it in the byte stream MUST describe 2 audio tracks and 1 video track.</p>
            </li>
            <li>[=Track IDs=] are not the same across [=initialization segments=], for segments describing multiple tracks of a single type (e.g., 2 audio tracks).</li>
            <li>
              <p>Codecs changes across [=initialization segments=].</p>
              <p class="note">For example, a byte stream that starts with an [=initialization segment=] that specifies a single AAC track and later contains an [=initialization segment=] that specifies a single AMR-WB track is not allowed. Support for multiple codecs is handled with multiple <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The user agent MUST support the following:
          <ol>
            <li>[=Track IDs=] changing across [=initialization segments=] if the segments describe only one track of each type.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Video frame size changes. The user agent MUST support seamless playback.</p>
              <p class="note">This will cause the &lt;video&gt; display region to change size if the web application does not use CSS or HTML attributes (width/height) to constrain the element size.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Audio channel count changes. The user agent MAY support this seamlessly and could trigger downmixing.</p>
              <p class="note">This is a quality of implementation issue because changing the channel count may require reinitializing the audio device, resamplers, and channel mixers which tends to be audible.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The following rules apply to all [=media segments=] within a byte stream. A user agent MUST:
          <ol>
            <li>Map all timestamps to the same <a def-id="media-timeline"></a>.</li>
            <li>Support seamless playback of [=media segments=] having a timestamp gap smaller than the audio frame size. User agents MUST NOT reflect these gaps in the {{SourceBuffer/buffered}} attribute.
              <p class="note">This is intended to simplify switching between audio streams where the frame boundaries don't always line up across encodings (e.g., Vorbis).</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The user agent MUST run the [=append error=] algorithm when any combination of an [=initialization segment=] and any contiguous sequence of [=media segments=] satisfies the
          following conditions:
          <ol>
            <li>The number and type (audio, video, text, etc.) of all tracks in the [=media segments=] are not identified.</li>
            <li>The decoding capabilities needed to decode each track (i.e., codec and codec parameters) are not provided.</li>
            <li>Encryption parameters necessary to decrypt the content (except the encryption key itself) are not provided for all encrypted tracks.</li>
            <li>All information necessary to decode and render the earliest [=random access point=] in the sequence of [=media segments=] and all subsequence samples in the sequence
              (in presentation time) are not provided. This includes in particular,
              <ul>
                <li>Information that determines the <a def-id="intrinsic-width-and-height"></a> of the video (specifically, this requires either the picture or pixel aspect ratio, together with the encoded
                  resolution).</li>
                <li>Information necessary to convert the video decoder output to a format suitable for display</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Information necessary to compute the global [=presentation timestamp=] of every sample in the sequence of [=media segments=] is not provided.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>For example, if I1 is associated with M1, M2, M3 then the above MUST hold for all the combinations I1+M1, I1+M2, I1+M1+M2, I1+M2+M3, etc.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Byte stream specifications MUST at a minimum define constraints which ensure that the above requirements hold. Additional constraints MAY be defined, for example to simplify implementation.</p>
