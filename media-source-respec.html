      <p>The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/media-source/issues">a list of all bug reports that the editors have not yet tried to address</a>; there may also be open bugs in the <a href="http://w3.org/brief/Mjcw">previous bug tracker</a>. This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.</p>
        <p>Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the discussions are likely to find the specification changing out from under them in incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage should join the mailing list mentioned below and take part in the discussions.</p>

        <p>The following features are <strong>at risk</strong> and may be removed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The <a def-id="appendStream">appendStream</a> method on the <a href="#sourcebuffer">sourceBuffer</a> object and algorithm steps that are used only by it.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <a href="#videoplaybackquality">VideoPlaybackQuality</a> object and the <a href="#htmlvideoelement-extensions">HTMLVideoElement Extensions</a> that use it.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <a def-id="totalFrameDelay">totalFrameDelay</a> attribute on the <a href="#videoplaybackquality">VideoPlaybackQuality</a> object.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <a href=#idl-def-TrackDefault>TrackDefault</a> object and its related objects, attributes, methods and algorithms, including: <a href=#idl-def-TrackDefaultList>TrackDefaultList</a>, <a href=#widl-SourceBuffer-trackDefaults>SourceBuffer.trackDefaults</a>, <a href=#sourcebuffer-default-track-language>Default track language</a>, <a href=#sourcebuffer-default-track-label>Default track label</a>, and <a href=#sourcebuffer-default-track-kinds>Default track kinds</a>. Implementations still MUST at least include trivial versions of these default track language/label/kinds algorithms that are used by the <a href=#sourcebuffer-init-segment-received>initialization segment received algorithm</a>. These trivial versions would behave as follows: Trivial default track language and Trivial default track label algorithms MUST return an empty string, and Trivial default kinds algorithm MUST return a sequence with a single empty string element in it.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For this specification to exit the Candidate Recommendation stage,
          two independent implementations as detailed in the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/public-permissive-exit-criteria.html">CR Exit Criteria (Public Permissive version 3)</a> document
          will be required to pass each test in the MSE test suite to be
          developed by the HTML Media Extensions WG.

    <section id="abstract">
      This specification extends <a def-id="htmlmediaelement">HTMLMediaElement</a> [[HTML51]] to allow
      JavaScript to generate media streams for playback.
      Allowing JavaScript to generate streams facilitates a variety of use
      cases like adaptive streaming and time shifting live streams.

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This specification allows JavaScript to dynamically construct media streams for &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;.
        It defines objects that allow JavaScript to pass media segments to an <a def-id="htmlmediaelement">HTMLMediaElement</a> [[!HTML51]].
        A buffering model is also included to describe how the user agent acts when different media segments are
        appended at different times. Byte stream specifications used with these extensions are available in the byte stream format registry [[MSE-REGISTRY]].</p>

      <section id="goals">
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>This specification was designed with the following goals in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow JavaScript to construct media streams independent of how the media is fetched.</li>
          <li>Define a splicing and buffering model that facilitates use cases like adaptive streaming, ad-insertion, time-shifting, and video editing.</li>
          <li>Minimize the need for media parsing in JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Leverage the browser cache as much as possible.</li>
          <li>Provide requirements for byte stream format specifications.</li>
          <li>Not require support for any particular media format or codec.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This specification defines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Normative behavior for user agents to enable interoperability between user agents and web applications when processing media data.</li>
          <li>Normative requirements to enable other specifications to define media formats to be used within this specification.</li>
        </ul>

          </dd>

          <dt id="append-window">Append Window</dt>
          <dd><p>A <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> range used to filter out <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> while appending. The append window represents a single
            continuous time range with a single start time and end time. Coded frames with <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> within this range are allowed to be appended
            to the <a>SourceBuffer</a> while coded frames outside this range are filtered out. The append window start and end times are controlled by
            the <a def-id="appendWindowStart"></a> and <a def-id="appendWindowEnd"></a> attributes respectively.</p></dd>

          <dt id="coded-frame">Coded Frame</dt>
          <dd><p>A unit of media data that has a <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a>, a <a def-id="decode-timestamp"></a>, and a <a def-id="coded-frame-duration"></a>.</p></dd>

          <dt id="coded-frame-duration">Coded Frame Duration</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The duration of a <a def-id="coded-frame"></a>. For video and text, the duration indicates how long the video frame or text SHOULD be displayed. For audio, the duration represents the sum of all the samples contained within the coded frame. For example, if an audio frame contained 441 samples @44100Hz the frame duration would be 10 milliseconds.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt id="coded-frame-end-timestamp">Coded Frame End Timestamp</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The sum of a <a def-id="coded-frame"></a> <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> and its
                <a def-id="coded-frame-duration"></a>. It represents the <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> that immediately follows the coded frame.</p>

          <dd><p>A group of <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> that are adjacent and have monotonically increasing <a def-id="decode-timestamps"></a> without any gaps. Discontinuities detected by the
              <a def-id="coded-frame-processing-algorithm"></a> and <a def-id="abort"></a> calls trigger the start of a new coded frame group.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt id="decode-timestamp">Decode Timestamp</dt>
          <dd>
            <p> The decode timestamp indicates the latest time at which the frame needs to be decoded assuming instantaneous decoding and rendering of this and any dependant frames (this is equal to the <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> of the earliest frame, in <a def-id="presentation-order"></a>, that is dependant on this frame). If frames can be decoded out of <a def-id="presentation-order"></a>, then the decode timestamp MUST be present in or derivable from the byte stream. The user agent MUST run the <a def-id="append-decode-error-algorithm"></a> if this is not the case. If frames cannot be decoded out of  <a def-id="presentation-order"></a> and a decode timestamp is not present in the byte stream, then the decode timestamp is equal to the <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a>.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt id="displayed-frame-delay">Displayed Frame Delay</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The delay between a frame's presentation time and the actual time it was displayed, in a double-precision value in seconds and rounded to the nearest display refresh interval. This
              delay is always greater than or equal to zero since frames MUST never be displayed before their presentation time. Non-zero delays are a sign of playback jitter
              and possible loss of A/V sync.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt id="init-segment">Initialization Segment</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A sequence of bytes that contain all of the initialization information required to decode a sequence of <a def-id="media-segments"></a>. This includes codec initialization data, <a def-id="track-id"></a> mappings for multiplexed segments, and timestamp offsets (e.g., edit lists).</p>
            <p class="note">The <a def-id="byte-stream-format-specs"></a> in the byte stream format registry [[MSE-REGISTRY]] contain format specific examples.</p>

          <dt id="media-segment">Media Segment</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A sequence of bytes that contain packetized &amp; timestamped media data for a portion of the <a def-id="media-timeline"></a>. Media segments are always associated with the most recently appended <a def-id="init-segment"></a>.</p>
            <p class="note">The <a def-id="byte-stream-format-specs"></a> in the byte stream format registry [[MSE-REGISTRY]] contain format specific examples.</p>

          <dt id="mediasource-object-url">MediaSource object URL</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A MediaSource object URL is a unique <a def-id="blob-uri"></a> [[!FILE-API]] created by <a def-id="createObjectURL"></a>. It is used to attach a <a>MediaSource</a> object to an HTMLMediaElement.</p>
            <p>These URLs are the same as a <a def-id="blob-uri"></a>, except that anything in the definition of that feature that refers to <a def-id="File"></a> and <a def-id="Blob"></a> objects is hereby extended to also apply to <a>MediaSource</a> objects.</p>
            <p>The <a def-id="origin">origin</a> of the MediaSource object URL is the <a def-id="effective-script-origin"></a> of the document that called <a def-id="createObjectURL"></a>.</p>
            <p class="note">For example, the <a def-id="origin"></a> of the MediaSource object URL affects the way that the media element is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics-scripting.html#security-with-canvas-elements">consumed by canvas</a>.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt id="parent-media-source">Parent Media Source</dt>
          <dd><p>The parent media source of a <a>SourceBuffer</a> object is the <a>MediaSource</a> object that created it.</p></dd>

          <dt id="presentation-start-time">Presentation Start Time</dt>
          <dd><p>The presentation start time is the earliest time point in the presentation and specifies the <a def-id="videoref" name="initial-playback-position">initial playback position</a> and <a def-id="videoref" name="earliest-possible-position">earliest possible position</a>. All presentations created using this specification have a presentation start time of 0.</dd>

          <p class="note">For the purposes of determining if <a def-id="hme-buffered"></a> contains a <a def-id="timerange"></a> that includes the current playback position, implementations MAY choose to allow a current playback position at or after <a def-id="presentation-start-time"></a> and before the first <a def-id="timerange"></a> to play the first <a def-id="timerange"></a> if that <a def-id="timerange"></a> starts within a reasonably short time, like 1 second, after <a def-id="presentation-start-time"></a>. This allowance accommodates the reality that muxed streams commonly do not begin all tracks precisely at <a def-id="presentation-start-time"></a>. Implementations MUST report the actual buffered range, regardless of this allowance.</p>

          <dt id="presentation-interval">Presentation Interval</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The presentation interval of a <a def-id="coded-frame"></a> is the time interval from its <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> to the <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> plus the <a def-id="coded-frames-duration"></a>. For example, if a coded frame has a presentation timestamp of 10 seconds and a <a def-id="coded-frame-duration"></a> of 100 milliseconds, then the presentation interval would be [10-10.1). Note that the start of the range is inclusive, but the end of the range is exclusive.</p>

          <dt id="presentation-order">Presentation Order</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The order that <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> are rendered in the presentation. The presentation order is achieved by ordering <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> in monotonically increasing order by their <a def-id="presentation-timestamps"></a>.</p>

          <dt id="presentation-timestamp">Presentation Timestamp</dt>
          <dd>
             <p>A reference to a specific time in the presentation. The presentation timestamp in a <a def-id="coded-frame"></a> indicates when the frame SHOULD be rendered.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt id="random-access-point">Random Access Point</dt>
          <dd><p>A position in a <a def-id="media-segment"></a> where decoding and continuous playback can begin without relying on any previous data in the segment. For video this tends to be the location of I-frames. In the case of audio, most audio frames can be treated as a random access point. Since video tracks tend to have a more sparse distribution of random access points, the location of these points are usually considered the random access points for multiplexed streams.</p></dd>

          <dd><p>The specific <a def-id="byte-stream-format-spec"></a> that describes the format of the byte stream accepted by a <a>SourceBuffer</a> instance. The

      <h2>MediaSource Object</h2>
      <p>The MediaSource object represents a source of media data for an HTMLMediaElement. It keeps track of the <a def-id="readyState"></a> for this source as well as a list of <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects that can be used to add media data to the presentation. MediaSource objects are created by the web application and then attached to an HTMLMediaElement. The application uses the <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects in <a def-id="sourceBuffers"></a> to add media data to this source. The HTMLMediaElement fetches this media data from the <a>MediaSource</a> object when it is needed during playback.</p>

      <p>Each <a>MediaSource</a> object has a <dfn id="live-seekable-range">live seekable range</dfn> variable that stores a <a def-id="normalized-timeranges-object"></a>.  This variable is initialized to an empty <a def-id="timeranges"></a> object when the <a>MediaSource</a> object is created, is maintained by <a def-id="setLiveSeekableRange"></a> and <a def-id="clearLiveSeekableRange"></a>, and is used in <a href="#htmlmediaelement-extensions">HTMLMediaElement Extensions</a> to modify <a def-id="hme-seekable"></a> behavior.</p>

          <h4>SourceBuffer Monitoring</h4>
          <p>The following steps are periodically run during playback to make sure that all of the <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects in <a def-id="activeSourceBuffers"></a> have <a def-id="enough-data"></a>. Changes to <a def-id="activeSourceBuffers"></a> also cause these steps to run because they affect the conditions that trigger state transitions.</p>

          <p>Having <dfn id="enough-data">enough data to ensure uninterrupted playback</dfn> is an implementation specific condition where the user agent
          determines that it currently has enough data to play the presentation without stalling for a meaningful period of time. This condition is
          constantly evaluated to determine when to transition the media element into and out of the <a def-id="have-enough-data"></a> ready state.
          These transitions indicate when the user agent believes it has enough data buffered or it needs more data respectively.</p>

          <p class="note">An implementation MAY choose to use bytes buffered, time buffered, the append rate, or any other metric it sees fit to
            determine when it has enough data. The metrics used MAY change during playback so web applications SHOULD only rely on the value of
            <a def-id="ready-state"></a> to determine whether more data is needed or not.</p>

          <p class="note">When the media element needs more data, the user agent SHOULD transition it from <a def-id="have-enough-data"></a> to
            <a def-id="have-future-data"></a> early enough for a web application to be able to respond without causing an interruption in playback.
            For example, transitioning when the current playback position is 500ms before the end of the buffered data gives the application roughly
            500ms to append more data before playback stalls.</p>

          <a>SourceBuffer</a>.</p>

        <p>Each <a def-id="track-buffer"></a> has a <dfn id="last-decode-timestamp">last decode timestamp</dfn> variable that stores
          the decode timestamp of the last <a def-id="coded-frame"></a> appended in the current <a def-id="coded-frame-group"></a>. The variable is initially
          unset to indicate that no <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> have been appended yet.</p>

        <p>Each <a def-id="track-buffer"></a> has a <dfn id="last-frame-duration">last frame duration</dfn> variable that stores
          the <a def-id="coded-frame-duration"></a> of the last <a def-id="coded-frame"></a> appended in the current <a def-id="coded-frame-group"></a>. The variable is initially
          unset to indicate that no <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> have been appended yet.</p>

        <p>Each <a def-id="track-buffer"></a> has a <dfn id="highest-end-timestamp">highest end timestamp</dfn> variable that stores
            the highest <a def-id="coded-frame-end-timestamp"></a> across all <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> in
            the current <a def-id="coded-frame-group"></a> that were appended to this track buffer.
            The variable is initially unset to indicate that no <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> have been appended yet.</p>

        <p>Each <a def-id="track-buffer"></a> has a <dfn id="need-RAP-flag">need random access point flag</dfn> variable that keeps track of whether
          the track buffer is waiting for a <a def-id="random-access-point"></a> <a def-id="coded-frame"></a>. The variable is initially set to true to
          indicate that <a def-id="random-access-point"></a> <a def-id="coded-frame"></a> is needed before anything can be added to the
          <a def-id="track-buffer"></a>.</p>

        <p>Each <a def-id="track-buffer"></a> has a <dfn id="track-buffer-ranges">track buffer ranges</dfn> variable that represents the presentation time ranges occupied by the <a def-id="coded-frames"></a> currently stored in the track buffer.</p>

          <p class="note">For track buffer ranges, these presentation time ranges are based on <a def-id="presentation-timestamp">presentation timestamps</a>, frame durations, and potentially coded frame group start times for coded frame groups across track buffers in a muxed <a>SourceBuffer</a>.</p>

          <p>For specification purposes, this information is treated as if it were stored in a <a def-id="normalized-timeranges-object"></a>. Intersected <a def-id="track-buffer-ranges"></a> are used to report <a def-id="hme-buffered"></a>, and MUST therefore support uninterrupted playback within each range of <a def-id="hme-buffered"></a>.</p>

          <p class="note">These coded frame group start times differ slightly from those mentioned in the <a def-id="coded-frame-processing-algorithm"></a> in that they are the earliest <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> across all track buffers following a discontinuity. Discontinuities can occur within the <a def-id="coded-frame-processing-algorithm"></a> or result from the <a def-id="coded-frame-removal-algorithm"></a>, regardless of <a def-id="mode"></a>.
          The threshold for determining disjointness of <a def-id="track-buffer-ranges"></a> is implementation-specific. For example, to reduce unexpected playback stalls, implementations MAY approximate the <a def-id="coded-frame-processing-algorithm"></a>'s discontinuity detection logic by coalescing adjacent ranges separated by a gap smaller than 2 times the maximum frame duration buffered so far in this <a def-id="track-buffer"></a>. Implementations MAY also use coded frame group start times as range start times across <a def-id="track-buffer">track buffers</a> in a muxed <a>SourceBuffer</a> to further reduce unexpected playback stalls.</p>

                          <p class="note">Special processing may be needed to determine the presentation and decode timestamps for timed text frames since this information may not be explicitly
                            present in the underlying format or may be dependent on the order of the frames. Some metadata text tracks, like MPEG2-TS PSI data, may only have implied timestamps.

                            representation is used here because it is the represention for timestamps in the HTML spec. The intention here is to make the
                            behavior clear without adding unnecessary complexity to the algorithm to deal with the fact that adding a timestampOffset may
                            cause a timestamp rollover in the underlying timestamp representation used by the byte stream format. Implementations can use any
                            internal timestamp representation they wish, but the addition of timestampOffset SHOULD behave in a similar manner to what would happen
                            if a double precision floating point representation was used.

      <h2>Byte Stream Formats</h2>
      <p>The bytes provided through <a def-id="appendBuffer"></a> and <a def-id="appendStream"></a> for a <a>SourceBuffer</a> form a logical byte stream. The format and
        semantics of these byte streams are defined in <dfn id="byte-stream-format-specs">byte stream format specifications</dfn>.
        The byte stream format registry [[MSE-REGISTRY]] provides mappings between a MIME type that may be passed to <a def-id="addSourceBuffer"></a> or
        <a def-id="isTypeSupported"></a> and the byte stream format expected by a <a>SourceBuffer</a> created with that MIME type. Implementations are encouraged to register
        mappings for byte stream formats they support to facilitate interoperability. The byte stream format registry [[MSE-REGISTRY]] is the authoritative source for these
        mappings. If an implementation claims to support a MIME type listed in the registry, its <a>SourceBuffer</a> implementation MUST conform to the
        <a def-id="byte-stream-format-spec"></a> listed in the registry entry.</p>
      <p class="note">The byte stream format specifications in the registry are not intended to define new storage formats. They simply outline the subset of
        existing storage format structures that implementations of this specification will accept.</p>
      <p class="note">Byte stream format parsing and validation is implemented in the <a def-id="segment-parser-loop"></a> algorithm.</p>

      <p>This section provides general requirements for all byte stream format specifications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A byte stream format specification MUST define <a def-id="init-segments"></a> and <a def-id="media-segments"></a>.</li>
        <li>A byte stream format SHOULD provide references for sourcing <a>AudioTrack</a>, <a>VideoTrack</a>, and <a>TextTrack</a> attribute values
          from data in <a def-id="init-segments"></a>.
          <p class="note">If the byte stream format covers a format similar to one covered in the in-band tracks spec [[INBANDTRACKS]], then
            it SHOULD try to use the same attribute mappings so that Media Source Extensions playback and non-Media Source Extensions playback provide the
            same track information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>It MUST be possible to identify segment boundaries and segment type (initialization or media) by examining the byte stream alone.</li>
        <li>The user agent MUST run the <a def-id="append-decode-error-algorithm"></a> when any of the following conditions are met:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The number and type of tracks are not consistent.</p>
              <p class="note">For example, if the first <a def-id="init-segment"></a> has 2 audio tracks and 1 video track, then all <a def-id="init-segments"></a> that follow it in the byte stream MUST describe 2 audio tracks and 1 video track.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a def-id="track-ids"></a> are not the same across <a def-id="init-segments"></a>, for segments describing multiple tracks of a single type (e.g., 2 audio tracks).</li>
            <li>
              <p>Codecs changes across <a def-id="init-segments"></a>.</p>
              <p class="note">For example, a byte stream that starts with an <a def-id="init-segment"></a> that specifies a single AAC track and later contains an <a def-id="init-segment"></a> that specifies a single AMR-WB track is not allowed. Support for multiple codecs is handled with multiple <a>SourceBuffer</a> objects.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The user agent MUST support the following:
          <ol>
            <li><a def-id="track-ids"></a> changing across <a def-id="init-segments"></a> if the segments describes only one track of each type.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Video frame size changes. The user agent MUST support seamless playback.</p>
              <p class="note">This will cause the &lt;video&gt; display region to change size if the web application does not use CSS or HTML attributes (width/height) to constrain the element size.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Audio channel count changes. The user agent MAY support this seamlessly and could trigger downmixing.</p>
              <p class="note">This is a quality of implementation issue because changing the channel count may require reinitializing the audio device, resamplers, and channel mixers which tends to be audible.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The following rules apply to all <a def-id="media-segments"></a> within a byte stream. A user agent MUST:
          <ol>
            <li>Map all timestamps to the same <a def-id="media-timeline"></a>.</li>
            <li>Support seamless playback of <a def-id="media-segments"></a> having a timestamp gap smaller than the audio frame size. User agents MUST NOT reflect these gaps in the <a def-id="buffered"></a> attribute.
              <p class="note">This is intended to simplify switching between audio streams where the frame boundaries don't always line up across encodings (e.g., Vorbis).</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The user agent MUST run the <a def-id="append-decode-error-algorithm"></a> when any combination of an <a def-id="init-segment"></a> and any contiguous sequence of <a def-id="media-segments"></a> satisfies the
          following conditions:
          <ol>
            <li>The number and type (audio, video, text, etc.) of all tracks in the <a def-id="media-segments"></a> are not identified.</li>
            <li>The decoding capabilities needed to decode each track (i.e., codec and codec parameters) are not provided.</li>
            <li>Encryption parameters necessary to decrypt the content (except the encryption key itself) are not provided for all encrypted tracks.</li>
            <li>All information necessary to decode and render the earliest <a def-id="random-access-point"></a> in the sequence of <a def-id="media-segments"></a> and all subsequence samples in the sequence
              (in presentation time) are not provided. This includes in particular,
              <ul>
                <li>Information that determines the <a def-id="intrinsic-width-and-height"></a> of the video (specifically, this requires either the picture or pixel aspect ratio, together with the encoded
                  resolution).</li>
                <li>Information necessary to convert the video decoder output to a format suitable for display</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Information necessary to compute the global <a def-id="presentation-timestamp"></a> of every sample in the sequence of <a def-id="media-segments"></a> is not provided.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>For example, if I1 is associated with M1, M2, M3 then the above MUST hold for all the combinations I1+M1, I1+M2, I1+M1+M2, I1+M2+M3, etc.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Byte stream specifications MUST at a minimum define constraints which ensure that the above requirements hold. Additional constraints MAY be defined, for example to simplify implementation.</p>
