    <h1>Media Source Pipeline Model</h1>

<h2 id='pipelinedesc'>Non-technical description of the Process Flowchart image</h2>

    <p>The flowchart reads from a top down perspective. At the top is a container
marked MediaSource, with 3 arrows flowing down to containers each marked
SourceBuffer. (Not indicated, but for sake of clarity in this description
referred to here-after as SourceBuffer 1, shown with a blue background;
SourceBuffer 2, shown with a mauve background; and SourceBuffer 3, shown
with a rose background; as described from Left to Right).</p>


<p>Below these 3 SourceBuffer containers is a dashed line, with an indication
that the top half (MediaSource plus the 3 SourceBuffer containers) are taken
from the Media Source API, while the details to follow are taken from the
HTMLMediaElement.<p>



<h3 id='sourcebuffer1'>Flowing down from SourceBuffer 1</h3>


<p>Flowing down from SourceBuffer 1 is a blue triangle with 3 arrows pointing
to 3 process indications, each labeled Track Buffer.</p>

<p>The first Track Buffer from the left then flows to a red box labeled Video
Decoder, which then flows to an indicator (three dots stacked vertically)
labeled Video Tag Display Region.</p>

<p>The second Track Buffer flows to a green box labeled Audio Decoder, which
then follows to an indicator of an open switch, which then continues to an
indicator (green circle with an X) labeled Audio Device.</p>

<p>The third Track Buffer also flows to a green box labeled Audio Decoder,
which also flows to a switch, this time however indicated closed, which then
also continues to the same indicator (green circle with an X) labeled Audio
Device as the second Track Buffer.</p>



<h3 id='sourcebuffer2'>Flowing down from SourceBuffer 2</h3>


<p>Flowing down from SourceBuffer 2 is a mauve triangle with an arrow flowing
to a process indication labeled Track Buffer.<p>

<p>This Track Buffer then flows to a red box labeled Video Decoder, which
then flows to the same Video Tag Display Region previously mentioned in
SourceBuffer 1.</p>



<h3 id='sourcebuffer3'>Flowing down from SourceBuffer 3</h3>


<p>Flowing down from SourceBuffer 3 is a rose triangle with an arrow flowing to
a process indication labeled Track Buffer.<p>

<p>This Track Buffer then flows to a green box labeled Audio Decoder, which
then flows through a closed switch, which then also continues to the same
indicator (green circle with an X) labeled Audio Device previously mentioned in
SourceBuffer 1</p>
